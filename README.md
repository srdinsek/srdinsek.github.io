### Quantum chaos and ergodicity


### Quantum entanglement

We developed a method for calculating quantum Rényi entropy in large and strongly entangled systems with path integral monte carlo and path integral langevin dynamics.

With the new method we studied entanglement between protons in the molecular complex of formic acid dimer.

We studied the low temperature phase diagram of discrete $\phi^4$ model, and discovered that above the quantum critical point, the field undergoes a localisation in the imaginary time. We located the quantum critical point by calculating the behavior of quantum Rényi entropy with the method developed in [PRR]. 
If interpreted as protons in a chain of hydrogen bonds, this coresponds to the transition from delocalised protons to the formation of molecules.

Now I am interested in evaluating the entanglement in simulations of water ice unher high pressure, namely across phases VII, VIII, and X. The behavior observed is remarcably similar to the behavior in the discrete $\phi^4$ model, where it looks like the peak in the Rényi entropy overlaps with the formation of water molecules upon exiting the phase X and entering phases VIII or VII, detected by the same order parameter as used in the discrete $\phi^4$ model. The results suggest that phases X and VIII belong to the same thermodynamic phase, that differ only in the local properties, dictated by the quantum critical point at zero temperature.
