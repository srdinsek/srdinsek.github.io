We developed [a method](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L032002) for calculating quantum Rényi entropy in large and strongly entangled systems with path integral monte carlo and [path integral langevin dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04768). 

With the new method we studied entanglement between protons in the molecular complex of formic acid dimer.

We studied the [low temperature phase diagram of discrete φ^4 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04768), and discovered that above the quantum critical point, the field undergoes a localisation in the imaginary time. We located the quantum critical point by calculating the behavior of quantum Rényi entropy with the method developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 4, L032002 (2022)](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.4.L032002). 
If interpreted as protons in a chain of hydrogen bonds, this coresponds to the transition from delocalised protons to the formation of molecules.

Now I am interested in evaluating [the entanglement in simulations of water ice under high pressure](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04323383), namely across phases VII, VIII, and X. The behavior observed is remarcably similar to the behavior in the discrete φ^4 model, where it looks like the peak in the Rényi entropy overlaps with the formation of water molecules upon exiting the phase X and entering phases VIII or VII, detected by the same order parameter as used in the discrete φ^4 model. The results suggest that phases X and VIII belong to the same thermodynamic phase, that differ only in the local properties, dictated by the quantum critical point at zero temperature.
